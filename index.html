      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Zhou (Joe) Lan is an early-career biostatistics investigator at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. 
        He works closely with investigators in the Department of Radiology and serves as a key biostatistical collaborator, including as a core member of Dr. Lauren J. O’Donnell’s lab within Laboratory of Mathematics in Imaging.
Zhou earned his Ph.D. in Statistics from North Carolina State University, where he was honored with the Paige Plagge Award. 
His research focuses on the development of statistical methodologies for MRI data, with expertise in spatial statistics, Bayesian computing, and longitudinal data analysis applied to neuroimaging.
His work has been published in statistical journals (such as Technometrics, Biometrics, Bayesian Analysis, and Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A), neuroimaging journals (Imaging Neuroscience, NeuroImage: Clinical), and data science and informatics journals (Data Science in Science, JAMIA Open).
      </p>
<p>
Zhou is enthusiastic about collaboration, particularly in projects involving medical imaging data such as diffusion MRI (dMRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and positron emission tomography (PET). Please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in a conversation or potential collaboration.

  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p><h4>Statistical Methodologies for Diffusion MRI:</h4>The structural connections within the brain’s white matter are essential for its function. 
    Diffusion MRI tractography allows for the in-vivo reconstruction of white matter fiber pathways. 
    Diffusion MRI poses significant challenges due to their high dimensionality, spatial correlation, and complex signal structures. 
    My research focuses on developing and applying cutting-edge statistical and computational methods to unlock the full potential of such data. 
    The motivating data includes HCP Young Adult - -Connectome, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
    The key collaborators and mentors in this research avenue includes Lauren J. O'Donnell from Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School, 
    Brian J Reich from Department of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Arkaprava Roy from Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida,
    and Zhengwu Zhang from Department of Statistics and Operations Research, UNC Chapel Hill.
