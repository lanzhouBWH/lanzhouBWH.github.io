      <h3>Overview</h3>
 <p>
I am a computational and statistical investigator at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, with strong interests in biomedical data, particularly brain imaging, genetics, and cardiovascular data. My work can be viewed in two major components.
</p>

<p>
The first component focuses on building end-to-end pipelines that transform raw, large-scale datasets into reliable resources for clinical discovery. Leveraging these resources, I develop statistical and machine learning methodologies to address challenges such as high dimensionality, spatial correlation, and complex data structures. Reproducibility and accessibility are central to my work: each paper is accompanied by well-documented Python/R/C/C++ software (available at 
<a href="https://github.com/lanzhouBWH" target="_blank">https://github.com/lanzhouBWH</a>), enabling others to apply and extend my methods.
</p>

<p>
The second component centers on providing statistical contributions—including survival analysis, causal inference, and predictive modeling—for studies that utilize diverse biomedical data sources such as electronic health records, clinical trial data, and population-based cohorts. This involves design of experiments, hands-on analysis, statistical plan drafting, and manuscript/grant preparation.
</p>

<p>
My work has appeared in leading statistical journals (<i>Technometrics, Biometrics, Bayesian Analysis, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A, Data Science in Science</i>), as well as in top neuroimaging, genetics, bioinformatics, and medical journals (<i>Imaging Neuroscience, NeuroImage: Clinical, Bioinformatics, JAMIA Open, The New England Journal of Medicine</i>). In addition, as a statistical consultant, I have co-authored more than 50 collaborative papers in high-impact biomedical and clinical journals, including the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>, <i>Circulation</i>, and <i>Radiology</i>.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I am expanding my work to incorporate artificial intelligence for biomedical discovery and clinical translation.

  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p><h4>Innovative Statistical Methodologies for Diffusion MRI:</h4>The structural connections within the brain’s white matter are essential for its function. 
    Diffusion MRI tractography allows for the in-vivo reconstruction of white matter fiber pathways. 
    Diffusion MRI poses significant challenges due to their high dimensionality, spatial correlation, and complex signal structures. 
    My research focuses on developing and applying cutting-edge statistical and computational methods to unlock the full potential of such data. 
    The motivating data includes HCP Young Adult - -Connectome, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
    The key collaborators and mentors in this research avenue includes Lauren J. O'Donnell from Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School, 
    Brian J Reich from Department of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Arkaprava Roy from Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida,
    and Zhengwu Zhang from Department of Statistics and Operations Research, UNC Chapel Hill.

  <p><h4>Robust Statistical Methodologies and Theoretical Frameworks for Matrix-Valued Data:</h4> I focus on developing robust statistical methodologies and theoretical frameworks tailored to the complexities of real-world biomedical and imaging data. 
    My work emphasizes extending theoretical foundations to accommodate challenges such as high dimensionality, 
    spatial correlation, and intricate dependency structures, ensuring the developed methods are both robust and generalizable.

  <p><h4>Innovative Statistical Methodologies for Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS):</h4> 
    MRS is a critical tool for exploring the neurometabolic underpinnings of brain function, providing unique insights into the biochemical composition of tissues.
    My research has focused on developing and applying advanced methodologies to enhance MRS data processing, analysis, and interpretation, particularly in the context of neurological disorders such as functional neurological disorders (FND).
     The key collaborators and mentors in this research avenue includes Alexander Lin from Center for Clinical Spectroscopy, Department of Radiology, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital.
